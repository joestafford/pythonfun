Congratulations on making it to this stage in our candidate evaluation, and 
thank you for the time and effort you have committed to us.  What we are looking 
for in this stage is a sample of your coding style.  This is not just about 
getting the correct output, in fact that may be the least important part.  This 
is really about getting insight into your thought process and problems solving.  
And also about the look and feel of your coding style. So on to the problem:

Puppet has a feature called ENC, that calls an external script to generate a
node definition.  Your project is to write a python script that puppet will call.
The script should read 3 layers of configuration files, and merge these into a
single yaml output for puppet.

Three files are provided as sample of each configuration layer:

global.yaml  - configuration applicable to all nodes
app-red.yaml - application specific configuration for a subset (red) of nodes
red10.yaml   - configuration specific to the node red10.tracelink.com

If you have any questions feel free to email me, and once you are happy with
your script you can email me a link to the script, or attache it to an email. 
Do note however that our email system will block executable file types so
please replace the .py with .txt  in the file name.

Thanks
